This is an experiment. It's meant to be a python project to control a small lift
that only has two levels, and ground level and a first level.

Currently this project is setup to use "pip-compile" from the pip-tools package to 
build a requirements file in the dumb_water.egg-info/request.txt file. However
the author hasn't setup all the tooling (and instructions) to do a full python
source package build, and upload to somewhere (like github files for releases).

To use this software you should: (this is an aspirational series of steps, they haven't been tested yet)
 0. setup your raspberry pi so you have console access to it, python is installed, and pip-tools is installed.
 1. clone the repo to your raspberry pi, preferably into ~/dumbwaiter_lift
 2. create a python venv (preferrably in ~/venv-lift) and activate it
    1. python -m venv ~/venv-lift
    1. source ~/venv-lift/bin/activate
 3. Install the requirements. Run pip install -r ~/dumbwaiter_lift/requirements.txt
 4. run it by executing dumbwaiter_lift (or maybe: python ~/dumbwaiter_lift/src/__main__.py)

 Once you are happy with it working you could copy the systemd-user.service file to ~/.config/systemd/user/dumb-waiter.service, and then run 'systemctl --user start dumb-waiter.service'.
